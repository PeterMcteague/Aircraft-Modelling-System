AircraftDecoration is a package of classes for decorating aircrafts with additional properties such as kids areas, and bars, to suit the needs of their passengers
better. As an extension you could also add better engines etc to the plane.

It has been created as a solution for Advanced Java Programming, ICA1, Task 2 for a part of scenario 2 - the airport routing controller.
Specifically for a component for putting extensions onto planes.

To run the driver class, open the Project using an installation of the Netbeans IDE (Tested with 8.2 but I can't think of any reason it couldn't work on some older versions).
To do this, run netbeans, click file, open project and then open the folder this readme resides in. One you have done this, double click any class in the project on the left hand side
(I.e. anything under ICA2AircraftDecorator/sourcepackages/aircraftdecoration).
and then press F6 on your keyboard or click Run -> Run Project.
There will then be a demonstration printed in the output window of the netbeans IDE.

To run the test classes, open the project with Netbeans, like you did with the Driver class. 
Then in the left column where you found the classes before, open ICA2AircraftDecorator/testpackages/AircraftDecoration/ and right click and press "run file" on any of the tests you want to run.
You will see the results of the test at the bottom of your screen.
